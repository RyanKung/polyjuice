# Routes configuration
# Uncomment and configure based on your domain setup
# routes = [
#   { pattern = "miniapp.polyjuice.io/*", zone_name = "polyjuice.io" }

# Environment variables
# These can be overridden by secrets set via: wrangler secret put <NAME>
[vars]
# Your production URL where the miniapp is hosted
BASE_URL = "https://miniapp.polyjuice.io"

# SOURCE_URL: Optional. If set, use this as the source URL for fetching content.
# If not set, will use GitHub Pages format: https://{GITHUB_USERNAME}.github.io
# Example: SOURCE_URL = "https://your-custom-domain.com"
# SOURCE_URL = "https://your-custom-domain.com"

# GitHub username (used if SOURCE_URL is not set)
# This will be used to construct: https://{GITHUB_USERNAME}.github.io
GITHUB_USERNAME = "your-username"  # Replace with your GitHub username

# For production, it's recommended to use secrets instead of vars:
# wrangler secret put BASE_URL
# wrangler secret put SOURCE_URL  # Optional: for custom source URL
# wrangler secret put GITHUB_USERNAME
